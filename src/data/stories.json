I had the chance to partake into church camp for the first time and to volunteer at the Early Morning Centre. These experiences really opened my eyes on the joys of serving my community, my church and our God! Hope Church and all of your life groups ‚Äî thank you for your warm welcoming and support throughout this journey!",

      "quote": "I am blessed to encounter with God when I was in my early 20s as a student, through HOC and Hope Canberra church. Many decisions and the priorities in life lately have been forever changed. When you submit and serve God from a young age, you are able to see the great transformation power and strength of God to act in your life. And how he gives you purpose of life and wilderness dreams for his kingdom beyond imagination. Just as Ecclesiastes 12:1 said, remember our creator in the days of youth, seeking and serving God from one's youth sets the foundation of life and is the best decision you can ever make.",
